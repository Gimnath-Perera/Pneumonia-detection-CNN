Welcome to the Pneumonia Classification repository! This project aims to provide an accurate and efficient deep learning model for identifying various stages of pneumonia in X-ray images of the lungs. By leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the TensorFlow library, we have developed a robust solution that can predict pneumonia stages with high accuracy.

## Introduction
Pneumonia is a severe respiratory infection that affects millions of people worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis plays a vital role in ensuring proper treatment and care for patients. This project addresses the challenge of automating the pneumonia classification process, allowing medical professionals to make informed decisions quickly.

## Model Architecture
Our deep learning model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, a powerful technique in image recognition tasks. The model has been trained on a large dataset of labeled X-ray images, encompassing various pneumonia stages: Fusion beat (F), Unknown beat (Q), Normal beat (N), Supraventricular ectopic beat (S), and Ventricular ectopic beat (V).

## API Usage
We have created a convenient API using the Flask framework to facilitate easy integration of our model into web and mobile applications. The API enables users to upload an X-ray image and receive a prediction of the corresponding pneumonia stage. This allows for seamless integration into existing healthcare systems or custom applications.

## Installation
To get started with the Pneumonia Classification project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-classification.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the pre-trained weights for the CNN model (link: [weights.zip](weights.zip)) and place them in the `models` directory.
4. Set up the Flask environment variables (e.g., `FLASK_APP=app.py`) or configure your preferred deployment method.

## Usage
Once you have completed the installation, you can run the project and start making predictions. Here's a simple guide to getting started:

1. Start the Flask API server: `flask run`
2. Make a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with the X-ray image data. You can use various methods like cURL, Postman, or integrate it into your application using your preferred programming language.

```python
import requests

image_path = '/path/to/xray_image.jpg'
url = 'http://localhost:5000/predict'

# Read the image file
with open(image_path, 'rb') as image_file:
    image_data = image_file.read()

# Send the image data to the API
response = requests.post(url, files={'image': image_data})

# Retrieve the prediction
prediction = response.json()['prediction']
print(f"The predicted pneumonia stage is: {prediction}")
```
